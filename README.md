# Reading sessions

Our [もくもく会 ML Math Reading Sessions](https://machinelearningtokyo.com/2019/11/28/ml-math-reading-sessions/) were based on "Mathematics For Machine Learning" by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong, to be published by Cambridge University Press. https://mml-book.github.io/

Sessions were held bi-weekly in different time zones on Sundays (PST, EST, GMT, CET, IST) and Mondays (APAC).


## Part I: Mathematical Foundations

- Introduction and Motivation
- Linear Algebra
- Analytic Geometry
- Matrix Decompositions
- Vector Calculus
- Probability and Distribution
- Continuous Optimization

## Part II: Central Machine Learning Problems

- When Models Meet Data
- Linear Regression
- Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis
- Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models
- Classification with Support Vector Machines
